# Javachat ☕️💬

A chat on terminal using Java + communication between network sockets using the TCP protocol


## How to use 🤔

Using your terminal navigate to the directory containing the files `ChatServer.java` and `ChatClient.java`.

Start the server using the command `java ChatServer`. After that, you will have a server on port `12345`.

To start the client, use the command `java ChatClient`. The program will ask for the server's IP address. If you're running local, enter your machine's IP or the IP for localhost: `127.0.0.1`. Enter your username and start chatting with your friends!
